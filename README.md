# Porting_VADiodeLadderFilter_To_Embedded_C
THIS REPO IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, so no listing any "issues" on it until I say it is functioning. 
Porting the VADiodeLadderFilter Rack AFX plugin to Embedded C++. That plugin's original author is apparently Will Pirkle. So a special thanks to that apparently highly skilled DSP engineer.
